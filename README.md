Power Patterns: Harnessing Electricity for Innovation

# Notes

## Ideas for feature engineering

* Predictability:
  - How concentrated or repeatable is the load?
  - Could be a proxy for what is shiftable
* Occurrence of distinct events
  - Are there any obvious demand shapes that occur that are distinct from
* Difference between base load and peaks
* Sensitivity to weather

# To Do

* Account for daylight savings
* Account for seasonal change
